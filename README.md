# OpenNoodl

OpenNoodl is a fork of the original Noodl open source code under GPL-3.0 license. OpenNoodl / Noodl is a front end React app builder with a visual programming interface. 

OpenNoodl will aim to stay entirely in sync with the original repository, including future updates to this repository. A roadmap for updates will be published soon.

## Integrated back-end

### Cloud hosted

OpenNoodl has native CRUD nodes that work with Parse Server backends. [OpenNoodl Hosting](https://opennoodl-hosting.com) provides free and paid Parse Server backends to help you get started.

### Self hosted

If you prefer self-hosting or a local backend, while still taking advantage of the native OpenNoodl CRUD nodes, check out the repositories of the original [Noodl Cloud Services backend](https://github.com/The-Low-Code-Foundation/opennoodl-cloudservice) (Parse and cloud functions), as well as the new [OpenNoodl Better Backend](https://github.com/The-Low-Code-Foundation/opennoodl-better-backend) (Parse and n8n).

## Building from source

```bash
# Install all dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the Noodl Editor and build a production version of the cloud and react runtime (useful when running Noodl from source but want to deploy to production)
$ npm start

# Start the Noodl Editor and watch the filesystem for changes to the runtimes. Development versions of the runtimes, not meant for production (mostly due to source maps and file size)
# This is ideal for a quick workflow when doing changes on the runtimes.
$ npm run dev

# Start Noodl Editor test runner
$ npm run test:editor
```
